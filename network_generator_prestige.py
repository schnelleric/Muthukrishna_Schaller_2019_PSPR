def human_social_network_prestige(grid, geodesic):
    """
    Returns a network that mimics human social networks where people try to connect to those who have more important
    connections, as calculated using eigenvector centrality. Connections are only possible between nodes a distance of
    k apart. Connections between nodes become exponentially less likely the further apart they are from each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : (int, int)
        Tuple of grid dimensions. Number of nodes in network is grid[0]*grid[1]
    geodesic : float
        Desired average shortest path length / degrees of separation (geodesic)
        This will be treated as an upper bound

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works by creating a grid where nodes are connected to their neighbors
    to the North, South, East, and West. The top and bottom of the grid and left and right
    are connected to form a torus, ensuring all nodes have the same number of edges initially.

    At each iteration one node is selected at random to receive a new edge with a node within a distance of k to them.
    The node is more likely to connect to a node with many important connections and that is nearby.

def network_equilibrium(G, initial_nbrs, d, p):
    """
    Returns a network with the same properties as a human social network, namely high clustering, low average shortest
    distance and a skewed degree distribution. This is achieved by applying an algorithm that makes new connections
    using prestige and distance. The algorithm includes a birth-death process which prevents the network from reaching
    completness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        Inputted graph of already desired parameters
    initial_nbrs: dict
        Lists the initial neighbours for each node
    d : float
        Strength of the distance decay function
    p : float
        Probability of a node losing most of its edges at a given iteration

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works by taking a graph and at each iteration adding an edge between nodes based on prestige
    mechanics. At every iteration there is also a chance that one node gets all but its initial four edges (to its left,
    right, up, and down) removed.
